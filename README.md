1. **Preprocess the dataset** by loading `crop.csv` and splitting it into training and test subsets using stratified sampling.  
2. **Induce multiple decision tree models** by constructing hierarchical clusteringâ€“based trees with randomized feature orderings to ensure model diversity.  
3. **Evaluate and select models** that achieve test accuracy above a defined threshold, retaining only high-performing trees in the ensemble.  
4. **Aggregate predictions** through majority voting across selected models to obtain a stable and accurate classification outcome.
